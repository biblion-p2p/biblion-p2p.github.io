<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Biblion is a platform for creating self-defining decentralized data communities.
Nodes within Biblion participate in a global content-addressable file sharing
network. Users can share files and create communities called "libraries".
Libraries are defined by a configuration file that defines
provided by the Biblion application, or define completely custom code. At the
core of Biblion is a modern networking stack that supports peer authentication
and stream multiplexing.

<h3>Overview</h3>

Biblion is a platform for peer-to-peer networks built from the ground up.

- P2P, contentaddressable store
- BitTorrent style downloads
- DHT and blockchain
- Library definitions
  - Ownership and usership
  - Authorization strategies
  - Pluggable routing (DHT, DNS, etc)
- Nanobartering/agorics
- Networking
  - Multiplexing
    - One authentication scheme. Multiple transports.

<h3>Existing Work</h3>

IPFS/Libp2p - The Interplanetary File System[]
MojoNation/Mnet -

Bitcoin
Ethereum
Freenet
Tor

<h3>Platform</h3>

Peers
Streams
Tranports
Services


<h3>Library Achitecture</h3>
- Ownership
- Managing users
- Gossip protocols
- Privacy

<h3>Network Architecture</h3>
- Multiplexing of requests, over multiplexed transports
- define "channel"
- QUIC and TLS1.3
- UDP auth cookies
- Peer storage

<h3>Core Services</h3>

BitTorrent
Kademlia
Blockchain
Gossip
Bank
UserSet

<h3>Future Work</h3>
-Network hardening (QUIC)
-Additional configuration rules for libraries
-Biblion 2.0 (library configurations should be able to reference arbitrary code)
-Community types and incentive strategies
  - Completely private/disconnected libraries
