Biblion is a platform for creating self-defining peer-to-peer data communities.
Peers within Biblion participate in a global content-addressable file sharing
network. Users can share files and create communities called "libraries".
Libraries are defined by a definition file that describes and configures the
services provided by that community. Services can be those included with the
Biblion distribution, or be defined by completely custom code. The
protocols provided by a library can include incentivization systems that
encourage user participation and help keep files alive. Unlike many recent
distributed information systems, Biblion intentionally supports the notion of
"trusting" particular peers to provide a protected service, within a library. At the
low-level of Biblion is a modern networking stack that provides peer authentication
and stream multiplexing.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Biblion is a platform for peer-to-peer networks built from the ground up. Taking
inspiration from BitTorrent, IPFS, and various HTTP-based web applications,
Biblion attempts to be a holistic solution to decentralized information hosting.
Specifically, Biblion is designed for storing static immutable content. The
content can be in any form, including HTML documents, PDFs, plaintext, video
files, and anything else that can stored in a static file.</p>

<p>A peer-to-peer network is a network of computers in which participants
  communicate directly with each other. Unlike client-server applications,
  nodes in these networks are able to both service and make requests. Peer-to-peer
  networks can depend on the existence of centralized services that run on the
  side, such as "trackers" in many BitTorrent deployments, which are used to
  help peers find each other. File sharing is one of the most popular uses for
  peer-to-peer networks, since every peer can contribute pieces of their storage
  to participate. This has been the basis of many systems, including BitTorrent,
  Gnutella, IPFS, and many more. Biblion is a peer-to-peer file sharing network
  that attempts to provide the convenience and effectiveness of centralized
  services with the resilience and flexibility of decentralized systems.</p>

<p>At the heart of a Biblion is a content-addressable file store. Files are
  identified by their SHA256 hash. Given a hash, the Biblion software can find
  the file and download it locally. Each Biblion node maintains an offline
  store of file objects that caches Biblion objects. Because files are identified
  by a strong hash function, they are immutable. Every file in a file store has
  its integrity verified by validating the hash.</p>

<p>To support effective downloads, peers communicate using a BitTorrent-like
  protocol. A download occurs across multiple peers, and can work around slow
  peers over time.</p>

<p>Peers find each other by paricipating in global Kademlia-like distributed
  hash table (DHT). Nodes on this DHT are identified by their public key, which
  is in turn used to verify the node's identity during a connection.</p>

<p>As described, this system already provides a scalable global solution for
  distributing files across the internet, providing integrity protection for
  multiple files. The system described thusfar is nearly equivalent to the
  Mainline DHT used in BitTorrent, which allows clients to find peers for a
  download without the use of a centralized tracker. It is also extremely
  similar to IPFS, but is missing a piece. What we need is a solution to the
  "free-rider problem".</p>

<p>In peer-to-peer networking, the free-rider problem refers to the issue of
 preventing malicious nodes from taking advantage of good natured nodes in
 order to use the system unfairly. In a file sharing community, this generally
 means that "free rider" is somehow who tries to download data without offering
 data to upload in return. Preventing this activity on a massive scale is
 difficult to solve effectively, because reputation stores either require
 trusted participation or slow consensus mechanisms.</p>

<p>Biblion solves the free-rider problem by splitting the network into a
  potentially infinite number of heterogenous small networks that define
  their own solutions. While a global trusted reputation system is undesirable
  for the global network, such a solution can work well within the context of a
  smaller network. These small networks are created and defined by users
  themselves, and can take any form. These smaller networks are called "libraries".</p>

<p>A library is a peer-to-peer community defined within Biblion. Like Biblion
  itself, a library can be built using DHT based peer discovery, and BitTorrent
  style downloads. Because these smaller networks are using the same technology,
  the same programs are repurposed for use in both the Biblion network and the
  libraries. Unlike the global Biblion network, libraries can define authorization
  strategies for limiting activity within the network. For example, a library
  may maintain a record of the upload and download history of a peer, and the
  decision to allow a certain download would be based off of that history.</p>

<p>To provide these advanced services, libraries have centralized services and
  trusted peers. The trust and power of these peers is limited strictly within
  the context of a library. When a peer joins a library, they are aware of what
  the trust model is, and where the power within the library lies.</p>

<h3>Existing Work</h3>

<p>There has recently been a huge amount of development in decentralized systems.
In the wake of the NSA revelations, people are more concerned about how to make
data more resilient, more open, and more private. Biblion takes inspiration
from both older systems and recent developments.</p>
