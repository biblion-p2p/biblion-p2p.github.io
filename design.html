Biblion is a platform for creating self-defining peer-to-peer data communities.
Peers within Biblion participate in a global content-addressable file sharing
network. Users can share files and create communities called "libraries".
Libraries are defined by a definition file that describes and configures the
services provided by that community. Services can be those included with the
Biblion distribution, or be defined by completely custom code. The
protocols provided by a library can include incentivization systems that
encourage user participation and help keep files alive. Unlike many recent
distributed information systems, Biblion intentionally supports the notion of
"trusting" particular peers to provide a protected service, within a library. At the
low-level of Biblion is a modern networking stack that provides peer authentication
and stream multiplexing.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Biblion is a platform for peer-to-peer networks built from the ground up. Taking
inspiration from BitTorrent, IPFS, and various HTTP-based web applications,
Biblion attempts to be a holistic solution to decentralized information hosting.
Specifically, Biblion is designed for storing static immutable content. The
content can be in any form, including HTML documents, PDFs, plaintext, video
files, and anything else that can stored in a static file.</p>

<p>A peer-to-peer network is a network of computers in which participants
  communicate directly with each other. Unlike client-server applications,
  nodes in these networks are able to both service and make requests. Peer-to-peer
  networks can depend on the existence of centralized services that run on the
  side, such as "trackers" in many BitTorrent deployments, which are used to
  help peers find each other. File sharing is one of the most popular uses for
  peer-to-peer networks, since every peer can contribute pieces of their storage
  to participate. This has been the basis of many systems, including BitTorrent,
  Gnutella, IPFS, and many more. Biblion is a peer-to-peer file sharing network
  that attempts to provide the convenience and effectiveness of centralized
  services with the resilience and flexibility of decentralized systems.</p>

<p>At the heart of a Biblion is a content-addressable file store. Files are
  identified by their SHA256 hash. Given a hash, the Biblion software can find
  the file and download it locally. Each Biblion node maintains an offline
  store of file objects that caches Biblion objects. Because files are identified
  by a strong hash function, they are immutable. Every file in a file store has
  its integrity verified by validating the hash.</p>

<p>To support effective downloads, peers communicate using a BitTorrent-like
  protocol. A download occurs across multiple peers, and can work around slow
  peers over time.</p>

<p>Peers find each other by paricipating in global Kademlia-like distributed
  hash table (DHT). Nodes on this DHT are identified by their public key, which
  is in turn used to verify the node's identity during a connection.</p>

<p>As described, this system already provides a scalable global solution for
  distributing files across the internet, providing integrity protection for
  multiple files. The system described thusfar is nearly equivalent to the
  Mainline DHT used in BitTorrent, which allows clients to find peers for a
  download without the use of a centralized tracker. It is also extremely
  similar to IPFS, but is missing a piece. What we need is a solution to the
  "free-rider problem".</p>

<p>In peer-to-peer networking, the free-rider problem refers to the issue of
 preventing malicious nodes from taking advantage of good natured nodes in
 order to use the system unfairly. In a file sharing community, this generally
 means that "free rider" is somehow who tries to download data without offering
 data to upload in return. Preventing this activity on a massive scale is
 difficult to solve effectively, because reputation stores either require
 trusted participation or slow consensus mechanisms.</p>

<p>Biblion solves the free-rider problem by splitting the network into a
  potentially infinite number of heterogenous small networks that define
  their own solutions. While a global trusted reputation system is undesirable
  for the global network, such a solution can work well within the context of a
  smaller network. These small networks are created and defined by users
  themselves, and can take any form. These smaller networks are called "libraries".</p>

<p>A library is a peer-to-peer community defined within Biblion. Like Biblion
  itself, a library can be built using DHT based peer discovery, and BitTorrent
  style downloads. Because these smaller networks are using the same technology,
  the same programs are repurposed for use in both the Biblion network and the
  libraries. Unlike the global Biblion network, libraries can define authorization
  strategies for limiting activity within the network. For example, a library
  may maintain a record of the upload and download history of a peer, and the
  decision to allow a certain download would be based off of that history.</p>

<p>To provide these advanced services, libraries have centralized services and
  trusted peers. The trust and power of these peers is limited strictly within
  the context of a library. When a peer joins a library, they are aware of what
  the trust model is, and where the power within the library lies.</p>

<p>A library is a set of services and trust relationships to those services. In
  a library's internal DHT, membership can be limited by a peer whitelist. For
  peers participating in the DHT, they will only honor requests or add nodes that
  are in the whitelist. Because each node participating in this library agrees
  to enforce the same whitelist, security is roughly preserved. The DHT in this
  example is immune to corruption as long as the nodes in the whitelist are
  secure. Meanwhile, data leakage is possible if any singular peer has been
  compromised.</p>

<p>Libraries can also define how files and data are located within a network. A
  DHT is effective and robust, but can have poor performance characteristics.
  Instead, a library can opt to host a set of mirrors that index *all* data
  within the library. This puts more stress on the indexes, but is much easier
  to manage. We imagine that multiple clever routing strategies inspired by
  distributed database design will be usable.</p>

<p>The definitions of these files are defined in JSON documents, that specify
  the nature of the service, its context, and what authorization is necessary.
  Because the specification is itself a file, library definitions are objects
  within the Biblion system just like content itself.</p>

<p>Authorization is an important concept within Biblion. The simplest form of
  authorization is a user whitelist. All identities in Biblion are verified,
  meaning we can be confident that a user is authorized to perform a certain
  action or access a certain piece of information. More advanced forms of
  authorization are accomplished by using a payments metaphor. Users are only
  able to perform a certain action if they have the required balance of a virtual
  currency, which is spent as the download occurs. This mirrors real world
  economies, and especially cryptocurrencies. Unlike most popular cryptocurrencies,
  balances within Biblion can explicitly be centrally managed. That is, a
  trusted party will maintain the balance sheets and verify that payments
  are settled correctly.</p>

<p>We are finally ready to offer a real solution to the free-rider problem.
  Within a library, trusted nodes can run a bank that manages balances of a local
  currency for use within the library. A user "spends" her tokens while downloading
  data from another peer within the library. This ensures that a user can only
  download as much as she uploads. Banks can allocate initial funds to users
  when they join a library, or generate new money in "freeleech" events: periods
  of time where downloads are free but uploaders are paid regardless. There are
  many strategies banks can use to increase the money supply while incentivizing
  good work.</p>

<p>Because the libraries are specified customly using defintions, libraries can
  come up with various competing strategies for encouraging community support.
  Because of the community driven nature of Biblion, we intend for the network
  to store content metadata as well as the data itself. BitTorrent and Usenet
  indexes provide huge value for users looking for particular files, but are
  prone to attack and censorship. By making the metadata indexes files in the
  system as well, the sites and communities are much more robust.

<p>They are not invincible, however. Censorship takes the form of eliminating or
  corrupting the leadership who have special permissions. In these events, users
  can take the data associated with the community - which they have been
  hosting cooperatively - and rally around new leadership. In the event of
  corruption of a bank, this will mean that the bank and its token will have
  to be abandonned, as transactions will no longer be processed. However, if
  the bank has a transparent balance sheet, the balances *could* be moved to
  new leadership.</p>

<p>Such events would surely have disastrous effects on the local currency. Even
  if the bank can recover the funds and adopt new leadership, there will be
  a confidence crisis, and the currency's value with respect to others will
  drop. These banks are also extremely vulnerable to temporary corruption. That
  is, library administrators could temporarily distribute funds illicitly to
  each other in an effort to exploit some market. We can avoid these situations
  by creating a bank with no leader: a proof-of-work blockchain. Blockchains
  allow us to update the funds as long as over half of the hash power committed
  to the chain is running correctly. This has proved extremely effective in
  practice, at the price of huge natural resources and performance. We implement
  a blockchain as a sort of central bank for Biblion. This central blockchain
  can be used to settle transactions across different local banks in a reliable
  way. We opt for proof-of-work to start, but hopefully we can switch to a
  useful proof-of-storage at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Libraries can implement their own blockchains as well. They can also define
  the criteria by which new blocks are accepted. This means a blockchain can
  be defined that uses a small set of hashers, or a small set of signatories
  who are the only ones allowed to update the banking records. This can then
  be used with blockchain consensus to maintain the state of user balances. There
  are several weaknesses in systems like this (bootstrap integrity being the
  most pressing), but they offer effective solutions to transparently managing
  payments in a performant way.</p>

<p>Libraries can define their own currencies. They can define how those currencies
  are spent. They can define what services are active within the library. The
  combination of these things means that libraries can collaboratively provide
  services of value to others. That is, a library defines a service which others
  can pay to use. Peers from outside the library could buy some of the currency
  local to the library and spend it on services within the library, and then
  sell the remainder of their currency for other things. Peers can invest in
  each other's libraries by buying the currency in anticipation of the value
  going up. Libraries can also define alternative services for payments. For
  example, a library could provide a VPN service that has exit points at
  various places worldwide, for navigating around firewalls. Other applications
  include video transcoding, proxying, anonymization, TURN relays, and much
  more. Because libraries can define arbitrary services, Biblion creates a
  market for collaborative services that reward communities that can provide
  the strongest service for the lowest price. These concepts are heavily
  inspired by the ideas of "agoric computing", but do not require rigid smart
  contracts. Rather, much like reality, the cost and rewards for services will
  be determined by the market, encouraging constant competition and growth.</p>

<p>Peers within Biblion may be members of dozens or hundreds of libraries. To
  have this system work effectively, peers reuse connections for all services.
  Services are multiplexed over the whole connection using a SPDY-like protocol.
  Every peer connection is authenticated when it's established. This ensures
  that each peer knows exactly who it is speaking with. Because services share
  code and connections, they can be implemented very effectively. Each service
  on a connection is simply an extra piece of state, which is only activated if
  a stream arrives that requires that particular service.</p>

<p>Taken together, we create a robust yet flexible file sharing network. Files
  can be transferred quickly and with integrity. Libraries can define
  incentivization structures that benefit all members. Members across libraries
  can collaborate by trading tokens within a global market. The community can
  update the code and services over time, ensuring that Biblion can evolve
  well into the future.</p>

<h3>Existing Work</h3>

[TODO: add links to all these things]

<p>There has recently been a huge amount of development in decentralized systems.
In the wake of the NSA revelations, people are more concerned about how to make
data more resilient, more open, and more private. Biblion takes inspiration
from both older systems and recent developments.</p>

<p><b>BitTorrent</b> is a peer-to-peer file distribution protocol. Peers upload
the content they have while they are in the process of downloading. By favoring
rare pieces and choosing to connect with peers with strong connectivity,
BitTorrent succeeds in providing extremely fast file distribution. Pieces are
verified as they arrive, ensuring data integrity. Peer discovery
was originally dependent on central services called trackers. With the development
of Mainline DHT, peers can find each other by participating in a collaborative
global routing table. The success of BitTorrent and Mainline DHT is a major
influence on Biblion.</p>

<p><b>MojoNation</b>, and its successor <b>Mnet</b>, were filesharing networks
 that drew upon the ideas of agorics. Users could "trade" resources amongst each other.
 There was a currency in place to allow users to set prices.</p>

<p><b>IPFS</b> is the Interplanetary File System. <b>Filecoin</b> is a companion
project to IPFS, and aims to incentivize storage on the system. These systems
also draw heavy inspiration from BitTorrent and DHTs. Filecoin actively
encourages research in useful proofs-of-storage, which could be extremely
useful to Biblion in the future.</p>

<p><b>Bitcoin</b> is the original blockchain currency.</p>
