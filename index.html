<h1>Biblion</h1>
<h3>A platform for building peer-to-peer file sharing communities</h3>

<p>Check out the prototype here: <a href="https://github.com/biblion-p2p/python-biblion0">biblion0</a>

<p style="color:red">
  NOTE: Biblion is currently extremely unstable experimental pre-alpha software.
  The developers assume no responsibility for losses or damages incurred by
  using this software.
</p>

<p>
  Biblion is a platform for building p2p communities. Like BitTorrent, it allows
  peers to connect directly and exchange files. But it can be used to host
  indexes of files themselves. It can also be used to build reputation and
  incentivization systems to encourage people to upload data. In a sense,
  Biblion allows creating your own BitTorrent tracker, including a user system
  and index, in a decentralized resilient way.
</p>

<h4>
  The Decentralized Web
</h4>

<p>
  The future of the web is decentralized. When you upload a photo to Facebook
  or post a tweet to Twitter, who owns that data? Once you submit your data,
  it leaves your computer and lives on the servers of a giant corporation.
  Is there a better way? Yes! It's decentralization.
  Instead of throwing your data into a corporation, you'll be able to host your
  data yourself, and decide how exactly you want your data to be shared.
  While many people have no interest in hosting their own data, a decentralized
  system allows building out a network of competing hosts that together form
  the foundation of the network.
</p>

<h4>
  Community building
</h4>

<p>
  Biblion lets you build communities called "Libraries". A library is a
  collection of files and users working together to make data available. Members
  of a library can choose to keep their files limited to its own members, or
  make them public. They can make them available for free, or limit access by
  use of internal reputation system. For example, you can limit users to only
  download as much as they upload.
</p>

<p>
  Libraries are an important part of the Biblion design. Without them, uploading
  a piece of information would just mean publishing it into the void. Associating
  your data with a community encourages group participation, and supports building
  traditional leadership structures for managing data.
</p>

<h4>
  Agoric computing
</h4>

<p>
  Biblion supports dynamic authorization for file transfers and library
  membership. Library owners can define systems of credits and tokens for
  ensuring that members only take as much as much as they give, among other
  strategies. In some sense, library members are "paid" for their cooperation
  within a library, and these tokens can be exchanged within the system for
  more data. This can be extended to trade tokens <i>between</i> libraries,
  enouraging cooperation and useful work.
</p>

<p>
  Because the authorization system is flexible, it can be extended to other
  protocols in the future. For example, tokens could be used to pay for
  packet transit on an anonymizing overlay network.
</p>

<h3>
  Use cases
</h3>

<p><b>Archivists</b> can make use of Biblion by creating a library for
their collections. Their data will be backed up by members of the community
who want to support the archive. If the archivist is on a limited connection,
they can add an authorization system to ensure members don't overwhelm
their connection.</p>
<p><b>Bloggers</b> and normal web site owners can host any data-centric
  sites on Biblion. People who enjoy your site can choose to back up your
  content. Should your site ever go offline, it would still be served by
  anyone who had backed it up.</p>
<p><b>Independent artists and content producers</b> can run their own stores for their
  content. By accepting payments, they can add users to a list of authorized
  downloaders, and ensure that only users who have paid can access the data.</p>
<p><b>Web communities</b> can choose to build out their systems on top of
  Biblion. A decentralized video site could be based on hosting data cooperatively.
  A music store platform could host submissions split across a network of nodes
  that they recruit to help them. Those hosting nodes could then be paid out
  using tokens at a later date</p>
