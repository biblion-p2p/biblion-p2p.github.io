It's easy to get started participating in a library, or creating your own.

First download the Biblion client software from here: [link]
If you're on Linux, there are build instruction on our github: [link]

Start the client after installation and you'll start with the initial setup.
You can set a password for your client for secure operations.
You can also set bandwidth and storage limits.
